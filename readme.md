#Here is the place to show the power of Emacs

Rule #1: Don't make Emacs too powerful at the begining. Don't drive an airplane when you can only drive a car.

Rule #2: Don't use start up kit unless you know everything there. You can easily get lost in the complicated settings and key bindings. 

The best way to use Emacs is to make it usable and build up its functions later.
